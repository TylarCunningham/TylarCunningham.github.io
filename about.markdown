##### Who am I?
My name is Tylar (aka, "CunningTea") and I'm a 25 year old software developer from Canada

##### What am I doing here?
I'm recapping/documenting my progress on a statically-typed, compiled programming language called "Klack"

##### Why does the website look like doo doo?
Apologies, I'm clearly not a web developer. This site was made using Jekyll and a mostly custom theme, very loosely based on [jekyll-theme-serial-programmer](https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-serial-programmer)

I've tried to make it my own, but it will likely undergo some small changes here and there to hopefully improve how things look a little
